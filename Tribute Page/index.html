                When Katniss was a child her father would bring her out into the woods beyond District 12
                to teach her how to hunt with a bow and arrow, as well as how to forage for edible plants. He would
                sometimes bring her to a lake far into the woods where she learned how to swim. It was on one of these
                lake
                visits that Mr. Everdeen introduced Katniss to the edible plant she was named after, and told her, "As
                long
                as you can find yourself, you'll never starve."
            </p>

            <p>
                Katniss was close to her father as a child and shared his appreciation for music. He was a good singer,
                so
                good that the mockingjays in the woods would stop to listen to him and copy his tunes. At some point, he
                taught her a song called "The Hanging Tree", a song about a man calling for his lover to meet him in
                death.
                When Katniss's mother heard her singing it, she began screaming at her father, telling him that it was
                dangerous and unsuitable to be heard by small children and could influence them. This was heightened
                when
                she saw Katniss and Prim make silver 'necklaces of rope', with the sisters being oblivious to the fact
                that
                the song was talking about voluntarily hanging themselves to death. She then banned the song from their
                home
                and forbade Katniss to sing it again outside. Although Katniss never sang it in her mothers presence
                again,
                she later sang it during the rebellion when she thought of her father. (In the book Mockingjay, where
                the
                lyrics are revealed)
            </p>

            <p>
                When Katniss was 11, her father died in a mining accident, causing her mother to fall into a deep
                depression
                and sadness. She became still and weak, refusing to listen to her daughters and becoming jobless. Unable
                to
                stir her mother from her bed, Katniss became the head and primary breadwinner of the family. In order to
                be
                resourceful, Katniss made their rations last as long as possible. When they ran out she attempted to
                sell
                some old clothes to make some money, to no avail. She tried to look in the garbage bins of the houses in
                the
                town square but was rebuked by the baker's wife for snooping. Peeta Mellark, the baker's son, gave
                Katniss
                some burnt bread that he'd been told to give to the pig. It is implied that Peeta burnt the bread
                specifically so he could give it to Katniss to save her life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Katniss begins to remember the knowledge her father taught her about the woods and about feeding
                herself. As
                she gains the courage to move deeper into the forest, she finds more game and is better able to feed her
                family. Katniss's mother begins to come back out of her depression, but Katniss can no longer trust her
                or
                rely on her. When she turned 12, Katniss signed up for Tesserae, causing her name to be entered four
                times
                in her first reaping. Despite this, Katniss is not chosen as tribute.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the woods, Katniss meets Gale Hawthorne, an older boy whose father died in the same mining accident
                that
                killed her father. Gale has provided for his family by setting traps and snares to catch game. The two
                eventually become a team and Katniss provides Gale with one of the bows her father made; she teaches him
                how
                to shoot and he teaches her about snares. Katniss is not very interested in politics but Gale is a
                political
                radical who dreams of an uprising against the oppressive Capitol. Katniss lets him vent to her but is
                otherwise unmoved. The two agree to protect each other's families if one of them is reaped.
            </p>

            <p>
                Katniss, like all children in Panem, is required to attend school except on certain holidays, including
                the
                Reaping. Unsure of her social skills and uninterested in making friends, Katniss's only school friend is
                Madge Undersee, though Katniss feels they are more like acquaintances than friends as they rarely talk
                and
                mostly just sit together at mealtimes and in classes. It is clear that Madge thinks well of Katniss and
                cares about her safety.
